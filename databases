Databases to consider
--

Pandokia is written for a SQL database using python dbapi, though using

databases.

sqlite3
	only supported database so far

	Works good, except during large transactions.

	limitations, it is not worth trying to adapt to this
	database when I already have sqlite support.

Firebird

Microsoft SQL Server
	not readily available; need license

Informix
	don't have one

Oracle
	don't have one

Sybase
	not readily available; need license


Why not an ORM

I don't know of any ORM that wouldn't just get in the way.  The table
structure and the capabilities in SQL are much easier to handle than
