This figure shows the navigable flow through the browser report
generator. 

The top level presents you with a list of test runs that are
available to browse through, and also the option to specify a given
test run (for example, the daily_latest run). 

Either path will take you to the treewalker, with which you can
navigate through the various test subsets, both hierarchically through
the test namespace, and by project, host, test run, and status.

Once you've narrowed to a subset of interest, the "show all" link will
take you to a summary report for this set. The summary report presents
a table with one row per test, including contact and
status. The summary report permits the comparison of this subset to
the same subset in another test; displaying test attributes; and
sorting by table column.

Clicking on a test name takes you to the detailed report for a single
test, which contains all the information about the test available in
the database. For tests that are "OK-aware", a "FlagOK" button is
present on this form, that can be used to mark a failed test "OK".
