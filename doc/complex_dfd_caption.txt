This figure shows the elements of Pandokia in more detail. The dashed
line marks the boundary of the machine on which the database
resides. All tasks that interact directly with the database are
run on this machine.

In addition to the standard test-import-browse data flow, some
additional flows provide enhanced bookkeeping. 
  - Multiple contacts can be associated with sets of tests; this
information may change, and changes must be imported.
  - A notifier sends a customized email with
reports of any anomalous (fail, error, or missing) test
results.
  -  Missing tests are detected by checking against a list of
expected tests, which is automatically updated when new tests are
added. 
  - Test reports can be exported from the database, and a small set
of database maintenance utilities are provided.
