Installing Pandokia
--

Pandokia has only been tested with Python 2.5.

Pandokia operates in two major modes:

TEST-ONLY refers to a machine that will run tests.

SERVER refers to a machine that runs the pandokia web application.  If
  you install the necessary third part softare, this machine can also
  run tests.


The outline is:

	- install third party software 	[both]
	- run setup.py 			[both]
	- edit config.py 		[SERVER only]
	- initialize the database	[SERVER only]
	- configure web server 		[SERVER only]

Install Third-Party Software
--

Pandokia requires this third-party software:

nose
	[TEST-ONLY machine]

	nose 0.11 is required on machines that will run tests.  You
	can download it from:

	http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.1/

	As presently configured, the pandokia plugin does not work in nose
        0.10.

sqlite3
	[SERVER machine]

	sqlite3 is required on the web server.  Pandokia does not
	currently work with any other databases.

	Pandokia was developed against version 3.6.10. The notify 
        functionality has been demonstrated to fail against version 3.1.3. 
        We have not determined the version dependency in detail; we
        recommend you use 3.6.10. 

	The sqlite3 python package is included with the python
	source code, but the python package is only installed if
	you have the sqlite3 libraries on your system.

	$ python
	>>> import sqlite3

	If you get an error, you do not have sqlite support in your
	python interpreter.  You need to get it from somewhere.

	- Many linux distributions have a sqlite package and sqlite
	  support in their python distribution.

	- You can install the library from sqlite.org and re-compile
	  your python interpreter.

	- In principle, you can install the library from sqlite.org
	  and then re-build only the sqlite3 python module, but I
	  never tried this.

a web server
	[SERVER machine]

	Web server software is required on the web server.  Any
	server that can run a CGI will do.

	We use Apache.  There is a baby web server included; you
	can use it to try out pandokia, but I really wouldn't
	recommend it for production use.

Run setup.py
--

Pandokia has a standard python setup.py.  Here are two ways to
use it:

python setup.py -q install

	This installs in the default location.

python setup.py -q install --home /some/path

	This installs pandokia in /some/path.  The scripts will be
	in /some/path/bin and the python files will be in
	/some/path/lib/python.

	You must set your PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables
	to include these directories.  


Edit config.py on the SERVER
--

Type 
	pdk config

to find the location of the configuration file.  Edit it for your
specific site.  The defaults are suitable for most of the values,
but you will want to change these for your site:

dbdir
	This is the fully qualified name of the directory where the
	sqlite3 database files will be stored.  This directory must
	be writable to 
		- the uid that runs CGI programs
		- anyone who will import data from the command line
		- anyone who will administer the database

	You must create this directory yourself and ensure that it
	has the correct permissions.

user_list
	This is a list of user names that are allowed access to the
	application.  Your web server must implement authentication
	for this to work.

	This feature is not well-tested.

os_info
	This is a list of machine names and brief descriptions of
	each.  The information is only used for display on some reports, with
	a default for unknown machines.

pdk_url
	This is the URL provided in the email reports as a shortcut
        for users to access the browsable reports. It isn't used
        for anything else at this time.

exclude_dirs
        Directories with these names are ignored when looking for tests.


Edit config.py on the TEST-ONLY systems
--

Most of the default values in the config file are sufficient for
a TEST-ONLY system, but you may want to edit the values of exclude_dirs.


Initialize the Database
--

You only need a database on a SERVER machine.

This release of pandokia uses two databases.  Type these commands
to initialize them both:

	pdk initdb db
	pdk initdb qdb


Configure Web Server
--

==
If you're using the pandokia test web server, skip this section.
==

You only need a web server on a SERVER machine.

The pandokia web app is a single CGI.

We expect that the web server will perform any access control that
is necessary.  For example, our pandokia server uses SSL and HTTP
BasicAuth to restrict access to authorized users.  We also have
firewall rules in place. Pandokia itself provides no access control 
mechanisms.

To copy the pandokia application into the web server, you can use

	which pdk

to find the name of the pdk program, then

	cp /where/ever/it/was/pdk /your/web/server/cgi-bin/pdk.cgi

NB: The file you are copying from is named "pdk" and the file
you are copying to is named "pdk.cgi" or whatever other name is
necessary for your web server to run it as a CGI.

During the setup.py phase, the location of the pandokia software
and the config file were written into this file, so it does not
need any further configuration.  At this point, you should be able
to access it through your web server.


Using the pandokia test web server
--

The pandokia web server is a baby web server that is just barely
capable of serving static files and running CGI programs.  To use
it to run pandokia:

	mkdir tmp
	cd tmp
	cp `which pdk` pdk.cgi
	pdk webserver

then point your browser at localhost:7070.  Click on "pdk.cgi" to
access the pandokia server.

This is a very primitive web server.  Notably. it has no logging
and no authentication.  You can use this to try out pandokia, but
if you plan to use pandokia for any kind of servious application,
you should get a real web server.


Notes on Configuring Web Servers
--

I can't help you with web server configuration.  Most web servers
are very complicated, and I don't even run my own web server.  (I
have an IT department that handles that.)

You can find information about authentication in Apache at:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/auth.html

You can find information about authentication in thttpd at:
