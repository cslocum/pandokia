Pandokia

"All your test are belong to us!"


What is here
--

INSTALL
	installation instructions

commands
	commands that you type to invoke pandokia

doc
	documentation here, including some example tests

pandokia
	the pandokia python module

pandokia_top
	indicator that test runner should not look above this directory
	for environment files; This is not the root of a test tree, but
	if we leave pandokia_top out of a subdirectory, this will limit
	the top of the tree.

sample_data
	a set of pandokia report files that you can import into
	your database for a simple demo

setup.py
	standard distutils-based installer

stsci_regtest
	a special test system used locally at STScI to test IRAF
        code. There are some associated files in commands and runners 
        as well.
        Not for general use.

stsci_regtest_tests
        its associated tests

tests
	various tests that pandokia can run; as of version 1.0,
	this is not a test suite of pandokia that we expect to pass
	all tests, but it is a set of tests that help us in
	testing/development.  ( Pandokia does not have a test suite
	that tests the pandokia system; the irony of that is not
	lost on us. )

tools
	various tools useful to the developers

databases
	list of databases considered

delta.gif
	nautical signal flag - maneuvering with difficulty
	use as icon for experimental versions

doc
	sphinx documentation

go
go_everywhere
	install scripts used at stsci

junit_notes
	notes from attempting to reverse-engineer the junit/xml format
	as written by nose and py.test; may want an importer that reads
	it someday.  (No, I can't find any useful documentation online.
	It all assumes you are an xml expert.)

pandokia
	the python package 

pandokia_top
